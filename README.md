Problem 1 - Symbol Balance - 40 points
Define a class called SymbolBalance in the provided empty SymbolBalance.java file.

Your SymbolBalance class will read through a Java file and check for simple syntatical errors. You should write two methods, as specified by the SymbolBalanceInterface which you must implement for full credit.

The first method, setFile, should take in a String representing the path to the file that should be checked.

The second method, checkFile, should read in the file character by character and check to make sure that all { }’s, ( )'s, [ ]'s, " "’s, and /* */’s are properly balanced. Make sure to ignore characters within literal strings (" ") and comment blocks (/* */). Process the file by iterating through it one character at a time. During iteration, the symbol currently pointed to in the loop will be referred to as <Current Symbol> henceforth.

You do not need to handle single line comments (those that start with //), literal characters (things in single quotes), or the diamond operator(<>).

There are three types of errors that can be encountered:

The file ends with one or more opening symbols missing their corresponding closing symbols.
There is a closing symbol without an opening symbol.
There is a mismatch between closing and opening symbols (for example: { [ } ] ).
Once you encounter an error, return a BalanceError object containing error information. Each error type has its own class that descends from BalanceError and each has its own required parameters:

Symbol mismatch after popping stack: return MismatchError(int lineNumber, char currentSymbol, char symbolPopped)
Empty stack popped: EmptyStackError(int lineNumber)
Non-empty stack after parsing entire file: NonEmptyStackError(char topElement, int sizeOfStack)
If no error is found, return null.

Only push and pop the * character to the stack when handling multi-line comments. Do not push the / character or the string \*.

You may either use your MyStack from the last assignment or you may the built-in java.util.Stack class.

We have provided you with a number of test inputs in the sub-folder TestFiles. We will use our own test files to grade your performance on all conditions - those files will be released after the assignment is due.

Problem 2 - Two Stack Queue - 20 points
Build a queue out of two completely separate stacks, S1 and S2. Enqueue operations happen by pushing the data on to stack 1.
Dequeue operations are completed with a pop from stack 2.

Obviously you will have to find some way to get the input stack information over to the output stack. Your job is to figure out how and when to do that, using only push and pop operations.

Write a class TwoStackQueue that provides the Queue ADT (by implementing the TwoStackQueueInterface) using two stacks. Your class should explicitly implement the interface provided above. Since the interface is generic, your class should be as well. Provide all methods specified in the interface. Your class should not use any additional memory to store the data in the queue except for the two stacks.

For your stacks, you may either use your MyStack from the last assignment or you may the built-in java.util.Stack class.

All methods must run in constant time, except for one, which is allowed to run in linear time occasionally.
